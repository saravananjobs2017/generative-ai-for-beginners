The following January, Suriya confirmed their reunion. Initially conceived as a biographical film inspired by true events, the project was delayed due to their respective commitments to Kanguva (2024) and Sarfira (2024), the Hindi remake of Soorarai Pottru. Discussions resumed in mid-2023 under the tentative title Suriya 43, as it would be the actor's 43rd film as leading actor. Jointly produced by Suriya's 2D Entertainment and Sudha's Meenakshi Cinemas, the companies made a public announcement on 26 October, confirming the lead cast and revealing a part of the title as Purananooru. Cinematographer Jomon T. John confirmed joining the crew few days after the announcement.\n",
            "In March 2024, after the project was reported to have been shelved, Sudha denied those claims and stated that she needed more time for the film's pre-production, that resulted in the delay of its shooting. However, the following July, Suriya was reported to have left the film, and Sivakarthikeyan was in consideration for his replacement. Production was reported to commence after the latter completes his commitments, Madharasi (2025) and SK24. Aakash Baskaran's Dawn Pictures, a recently established production house, announced the project on 14 December, confirming the project, and the official title Parasakthi was announced on 29 January 2025. Made on a budget of ₹150–250 crore, Sivakarthikeyan was reported to receive ₹50 crore (US$5.9 million) as his remuneration. However, along with Sudha, he reportedly decided to take the revenue sharing model to benefit the film's production; as per basis, they would receive an advance and a major portion of the profits would be received as their remuneration. Sudha wrote the script, screenplay and dialogues with Arjun Nadesan, with additional dialogues provided by Madhan Karky and Shan Karuppasamy. Professor Dr. A.

The film stars Sivakarthikeyan as Major Mukund Varadarajan, alongside Sai Pallavi as his wife Indhu Rebecca Varghese. It is an adaptation of the book series India's Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes by Shiv Aroor and Rahul Singh, which contains a segment based on Mukund. The film follows Indhu Rebecca Varghese who receives the Ashoka Chakra for her late husband Mukund, remembering his  journey while on her way.\n",

Principal photography commenced in May 2023 with a sporadic schedule at Kashmir along with a schedule in Chennai, which was again followed by another schedule held at Pondicherry, and wrapped after a year.

As she journeys, her memories unfold the story of their life together and the man behind the uniform.\n",
            "Mukund, a spirited young man from Chennai, is deeply influenced by OTA, Chennai and the army officers' uniform from a young age. He meets Indhu during his college years — she's vibrant, principled, and socially conscious. Their connection grows gradually from friendship to love, though not without challenges, especially given Indhu's initial reservations about the risks involved in being an army wife, and getting married into a Hindu family being a Christian.\n",
            "Driven by his commitment to serve the nation, Mukund joins the Indian Army, and his life becomes a blend of rigorous discipline, camaraderie with fellow soldiers, and the longing for separation from Indhu. Despite their geographical distance and Indhu's & Mukund's rash family encounter, they eventually get married in both religious customs. Soon after, they get pregnant and have a daughter, Arsheya.\n",
            "The narrative then shifts to Mukund's posting in Kashmir, where insurgency is at its peak. The story doesn't shy away from the emotional toll and internal conflict soldiers face, especially Mukund, who balances duty and the desire to return to his young daughter and wife. He builds a bond with the local civilians, trying to bridge the divide between the military and the people, and gain access to militants within the social circles. There, he neutralizes two notorious terrorists, Altaf Baba & Abas Nangaroo. Through this, he earns profound dignity and respect among his fellow soldiers, Kashmir's other bases, and his senior officer Colonel Amit Singh Dabas.\n",
            "The story's end revolves around the Qazipathri Operation in Shopian, Kashmir. Mukund leads his CAT (Counter Action Team) tasked with neutralizing a group of heavily armed terrorists hiding in a residential area. Despite the risks, he ensures the safety of civilians and his men. In a final act of bravery, he charges ahead to draw fire away from his unit and is fatally shot. Despite multiple attempts to revive him, he breathes his last in the arms of his second-in-charge officer, Ravi Shankar. His martyrdom\n"
